# VMD_cpp
C++ implementation of Variational Mode Decomposition using Eigen
Project **VMD_cpp**  is an imitation of that in MATLAB(https://ww2.mathworks.cn/help/wavelet/ref/vmd.html).  I used eigen3 to refactor VMD in C++, so that we can use it without MATLAB. 

If you are looking for document to describe Variational mode decomposition, please turn to the original paper ( https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6655981) You can also find the MATLAB codes here.
